# Archetype contract

An archetype contract starts with the `archetype` keyword followed by a contract [identifier](/docs/reference/declarations/identifier).

For example:
```archetype
archetype escrow

/* ... */
```

:::warning
If generating contract [bindings](/docs/tests/framework#contract-binding) for test purposes, it is mandatory that the contract identifier be the same as the contract file name. For example, the identifier for the contract file `auction.arl` should be `auction`.

## Parameters

A contract may have parameters. A parameter value is not in the source code and is provided at deployment (origination) time. For example, the address of the contract owner is typically a contract parameter.

### Variable

By default, a contract parameter is an element of the contract storage. It is defined by an [identifier](/docs/reference/declarations/identifier) and a [type](/docs/reference/types). The list of parameters follows the contract's identifier between parenthesis and separated by comma.

For example:
```archetype
archetype escrow(seller : address, buyer : address)

/* ... */
```

The `seller` and `buyer` [addresses](/docs/reference/types#address) then need to be set at deployment time with the completium CLI's `deploy` command; for example:
```bash
completium-cli deploy escrow.arl --parameters '{ "seller" : "tz1VSUr8wwNhLAzempoch5d6hLRiTh8Cjcjb", "buyer" : "tz1aSkwEot3L2kmUvcoxzjMomb9mvBNuzFK6" }'
```

The value of a contract parameter may be modified by [assignment](/docs/reference/instructions/assignment) instructions in [entrypoints](/docs/reference/declarations/entrypoint).

### Constant

If a contract parameter is not meant to be modified, nor to appear in the storage, it may be declared `const`. Its value, provided at deployment time as for [variable](/docs/reference/declarations/contract#variable) parameter, is then *inlined*, that it replaces each occurence of the parmeter.

For example, the declaration of the [`FA 1.2`](/docs/reference/declarations/contract#variable) token contract:
```archetype
archetype fa1_2(const initial_holder : address, const total_supply : nat)
with metadata ""

/* ... */
```

## Metadata

The [TZIP-16](https://tzip.tezosagora.org/proposal/tzip-16/) specifies the standard contract's metadata as a storage [map](/docs/language-basics/container#map). It is declared with `with metadata` in contract declaration followed by intitial URL to metadata file:

```archetype
archetype my_token with metadata ""
```

This adds the [`metadata`](/docs/reference/expressions/variables#metadata) map to the storage.

A metadata template is provided [here](/docs/templates/metadata#example).
