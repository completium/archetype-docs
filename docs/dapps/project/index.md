# DApp UI

This section presents how to create and setup a DApp's User Interface (UI) project using React and Beacon's DApp/wallet interaction.

## Technical stack

### App Framework

Any framework is suitable to create a DApp application as long as a Tezos library is available for it. We present here how to create a *web* DApp with [React](https://reactjs.org/).

The choice of the React framework depends on the objective and the size of the application; typically a framework like [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is suited for large applications with needs for server side rendering. We are choosing [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) for its simplicity to create simple client-side & single-page applications: it installs and configures the whole pack of required bricks ([webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), [babel](https://babeljs.io/), ...)

### Language

It is *strongly* recommended to use [TypeScript](https://www.TypeScriptlang.org/) language as it will greatly shorten and ease up the development cycle. Its typed aspect makes that many errors are detected at compilation time (ie. at the time of writing code) rather than later at execution. It just doesn't make sense to developp with untyped languages when you think of it ...

Project templates configured with TypeScript are available with most UI frameworks. The following command uses `create-react-app` template with TypeScript:

```completium
npx create-react-app my-dapp --template TypeScript
```

This creates the `my-dapp` project. More information may be found [here](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-TypeScript/)

### Tezos library

While it is always possible to interact directly with the [Tezos endpoint's RPC API](https://tezos.gitlab.io/active/rpc.html), it is more than recommended to use a dedicated library that will wrap all services in high-level development services and take care of all the low-level Tezos protocol details.

In the context of web DApps for Tezos, the main library is [Taquito](https://tezostaquito.io/):

```completium
npm install @taquito/taquito
```

Taquito uses official cryptographic packages (aka libraries). Some of these packages relies on nodejs packages designed to run on the back-end side (server side, not in a browser). These packages are `crypto`, `stream`, `assert`, `http`, `https`, `os`. As a result, the default build process fails; it is then necessary to map these packages to their front-end counterparts in the build process:

Follow instructions available [here](https://web3auth.io/docs/troubleshooting/webpack-issues) to solve build issues.
:::

As a comment, `create-react-app` uses [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) (version 5) to bundle all resources as static web assets. It is then necessary to use the `react-app-rewired` package as described in instructions above, to be able to provide a customized webpack configuration without ejecting the react app.

### Wallets

A DApp needs to interact with a wallet to *sign* operations (transfers, calls to a smart contract, ...). Many wallets are available on Tezos ([Temple](https://templewallet.com/download/), [Kukai](https://wallet.kukai.app), [Umami](https://umamiwallet.com/), ...). It is common practice to interact with them all via [Beacon](https://docs.walletbeacon.io/) that implements the interaction standard [TZIP-10](https://tzip.tezosagora.org/proposal/tzip-10/) between a wallet and a dApp, as it greatly reduces the integration effort with wallets.

```completium
npm install @taquito/beacon-wallet @airgap/beacon-sdk
```

The main drawback of Beacon is the lack of control over the UI elements (typically the wallet selection popup), which can be a no-go if you want a tight control of the DApp L&F. In that case, each wallet needs to be integrated separately.

A plug-and-play *constate* context for Beacon services `connect` and `disconnect` is available [`here`](/docs/dapps/project/beacon).

### Contract binding

When interacting with a contract (read and write), it is *strongly* recommended to use its generated [TypeScript binding](/docs/tests/binding), that is a typed high-level TypeScript interface. It greatly reduces the effort to call a contract, read its storage and the number of runtime errors, as the compilier and LSP guides you through the contract interface.

TypeScript bindings may be obtained with the following [Completium CLI](/docs/cli/introduction) command:

```completium
completium-cli generate binding-dapp-ts mycontract.arl > mycontract.ts
```

:::info
Bindings generation is also available for Michelson (.tz) files.
:::

The generated binding interface relies on two packages:
```completium
npm install @completium/dapp-ts @completium/archetype-ts-types
```

### Contexts

With React applications, it is *strongly* recommended to setup [*contexts*](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) for application data (settings, UI states, ...) in read/write modes with a dedicated package like [constate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/constate) or [redux](https://react-redux.js.org/). This is preventing from awkward spaghetti code of passing components states and data through large hierarchy of components.

The DApp example presented here is using *constate* for its lightweight aspect.

```completium
npm install constate
```

*Taquito* and *Beacon* must be *singletons*, hence there are wrapped as contexts (with *constate*) to make them available to UI components. The same stands for the contract bindings.

The main 4 blockchain-related contexts are provided as plug-and-play code:

<Api title="Contexts" data={[
  { label: 'Settings.tsx', link : '/docs/dapps/project/settings', desc: 'Blockchain-related DApp settings' },
  { label: 'Taquito.tsx', link : '/docs/dapps/project/taquito', desc: "Provides Taquito's Tezos Toolkit hook" },
  { label: 'Beacon.tsx', link : '/docs/dapps/project/beacon', desc: <div>Beacon's <code>connect</code> <code>connect</code> and wallet address services</div> },
  { label: 'Contract.tsx', link : '/docs/dapps/project/contract', desc: 'Provides contract binder'}
]} />

## Architecture

Schema below illustrates the module and package architecture of the DApp and their interactions:

<Grid container>
<Grid md={1} xs={0} />
<Grid item md={7} xs={12}>
<ThemedImage
  alt="Buld DApp"
  width="100%"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('img/tutorial/dapp/dapp-light.svg'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('img/tutorial/dapp/dapp-dark.svg'),
  }}
/>
</Grid>
</Grid>

* Changes in `Contexts` data automatically redraw `UI` components that use them (React + constate hook mecanism)
* `Contexts` and `UI` interact with contract via `Binding`
* `Contexts` uses Beacon's services to connect to a wallet
* Taquito's Tezos toolkit uses Beacon as transaction signer
* `Binding` uses [`@completium/dapp-ts`](/docs/dapps/project/packagesapi/#completiumdapp-ts) package services to interact with blockchain
* `@completium/dapp-ts` uses [`@completium/event-listener`](/docs/dapps/project/packagesapi/#completiumevent-listener) to listen to emitted events

## File structure

Note that 4 directories are created under `src`:
1. `bindings`: generated contracts bindings
2. `routes`: page UI components managed by a *route* manager (for example [`react-router-dom`](https://reactrouter.com/en/main))
3. `components`: other UI components
4. `contexts`: hooks providers
