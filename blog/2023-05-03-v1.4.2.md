We present version [`1.4.2`](/docs/installation) of Archetype language.

## Added

### Contract import

It is now possible to use types and entrypoints declared in another archetype contract with the `import` declaration.

<!--truncate-->

For example, in order to import the `person` record from a contract, use the `import` declaration:
```archetype {3,7}
archetype anothercontract

import "somecontract.arl"

variable max_age : nat = 0

entry register(p : somecontract::person) {
  max_age := max(max_age, p.age)
}
```

See more information [here](/docs/reference/declarations/external-contract).

It is also now possible to orignate a contract from a Archetype source with [`create_contract`](/docs/reference/expressions/builtins#create_contract(handler,%20delegator,%20amount,%20init)) builtin.

### Global constants

It is now possible use global constants with [`global_constant`](/docs/reference/expressions/builtins#global_constant<T>(hash)) builtin.

### Initial support for Tickets

An initial working version of FA 2.1 with tickets is now available [here](https://github.com/completium/archetype-fa2.1).

```warning
Still a work in progress. Use with caution.
```

### Improved Michelson generation

Removed initial comment with initial storage value in Michelson format

### `rational` API

* [`simplify_rational`](/docs/reference/expressions/builtins#simplify_rational(r%20:%20rational))
* [`get_numerator`](/docs/reference/expressions/builtins#get_numerator(r%20:%20rational))
* [`get_denominator`](/docs/reference/expressions/builtins#get_denominator(r%20:%20rational))

### `list` API

The [`list`](/docs/reference/types#list<T>) type API has been enriched with the following builtins:
* [`head`](/docs/reference/expressions/builtins#head(l%20:%20list<T>,%20n%20:%20nat))
* [`tail`](/docs/reference/expressions/builtins#tail(l%20:%20list<T>,%20n%20:%20nat))
