We present the new instruction `emit` to emit an event, in a similar an event is emitted in languages like solidity.

This feater was suggested by [Nomadic Labs](https://www.nomadic-labs.com/). Thank you to [Bruno Bernardo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brunobernardo/) for the event well mechanism.

An event is declared with the `event` keyword, similarly to a record:
```archetype
event HighestBidIncreased {
  bidder : address;
  amount : tez
}
```
<!--truncate-->

The `emit` instruction is then used in an entrypoint as illustrated below:
```archetype
entry bid() {
  /* ... */
  if transferred > highestbid then begin
    highestbid := transferred;
    emit<HighestBidIncreased>({ source; transferred })
  end
}
```

### Event well

The emition of an event generates a call to a contract called *event well*. This contract provides a single entrypoint named *event* which takes an argument typed [`bytes`](/docs/reference/types#bytes).

The code of the event well contract is then:
```archetype
archetype event_well

entry %event(arg : bytes) {}
```

The event well is deployed at the address [`KT1AHVF5m8XaWPQCGgfAsZ9eSJJZ7WVGV2hE`](https://better-call.dev/ithacanet/KT1AHVF5m8XaWPQCGgfAsZ9eSJJZ7WVGV2hE/operations) on the mainnet, and at [`KT1ReVgfaUqHzWWiNRfPXQxf7TaBLVbxrztw`](https://better-call.dev/ithacanet/KT1ReVgfaUqHzWWiNRfPXQxf7TaBLVbxrztw/operations)on Ithacanet.

### Event

The `emit` instruction builds the event argument as a triplet of:
* the event name
* the event annotated Michelson type
* packed value of the event data

In the example of the *HighestBidIncreased* presented above, the following `emit` instruction:
```archetype
emit<HighestBidIncreased>({ source; transferred })
```

is equivalent to:
```archetype
const e = pack((
  "HighestBidIncreased",
  "pair (address %bidder) (tez %amount)",
  pack({
    bidder = source;
    amount = transferred
  })
});
const event_well = KT1AHVF5m8XaWPQCGgfAsZ9eSJJZ7WVGV2hE;
transfer 0tz to event_well call event<bytes>(e)
```

### Retrieve events

A Typescript library, called the [*crank*](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@completium/event-well-crank), is available to retrieve event data from a DApp.

The *crank* receives events from contracts and executes event handler functions.

For example, the `handleHBI` function below is executed when a `HighestBidIncreased` event is emitted by the contract:

```js
import { startCrank } from '@completium/event-well-crank'
import {
  HighestBidIncreased,
  register_HighestBidIncreased } from './bid-bindings.ts'

const contract = "KT1..." // address of the emitter contract

const handleHBI = (hbi : HighestBidIncreased) => {
  // ...
  console.log(`${hbi.bidder} is now the highest bid bidder.`)
}

// register Handler
register_HighestBidIncreased(contract, handleHBI);

// Start crank
await startCrank();
```
The HighestBidIncreased type and register_HighestBidIncreased function are bindings code generated by completium CLI:

```
$ completium-cli generate bindings-ts bid.arl > bid-bindings.ts
```

### DApp example

The *Bulb* DApp example is available [here](https://github.com/completium/bulb-event-demo).

The bulb is switched on/off by receiving events from the bulb contract. The contract is designed as a simplistic state machine with On and Off states. Two events `SwitchedOn` and `SwitchedOff` are defined and emitted respectively by `switchOn` and `switchOff` entrypoints:

```archetype
archetype bulb

states = | On | Off

event SwitchedOn {}

event SwitchedOff {}

transition switchOn() {
  from Off to On
  with effect { emit<SwitchedOn>({}) }
}

transition switchOff() {
  from On to Off
  with effect { emit<SwitchedOff>({}) }
}
```

A live bulb demo is available [here](https://completium.github.io/bulb-event-demo/).
